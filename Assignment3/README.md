# Assignment 3:

## Please read

For this assignment, only the final notebook file is important.
The directories only contains our drafts for each question.


For the question 3, as we didn't manage to generate the images with the GAN network in time, we left our draft for the GAN network (that failled).
Therefore, the GAN part of the question 3 can be ignored.
We managed to make the GAN work after the deadline but we didn't update the code in order to be fair with other groups.
